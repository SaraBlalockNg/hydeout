<!--Teaching is my first love, and I came to linguistics through the English as a Second Language (ESL) Teaching program at the University of Utah.-->I find real passion in teaching, and work to improve my teaching and mentoring abilities as junior faculty at Western Washington University.  During my graduate studies I was fortunate to learn the skills of pedagogy through mentorship from senior instructors and practice as both a teaching assistant and instructor of record. I actually discovered the field of linguistics while completing the English as a Second Language Teaching program at the University of Utah.  As an undergraduate, I was a student teacher of Intermediate ESL and Content ESL Math and Science at Cottonwood High School in Salt Lake City, Utah.  I also was a teaching instructor for language and assimilation tutors at Catholic Community Services of Utah.

As a graduate student at UW, I was a TA for various Linguistics and Computer Science courses.  My teaching evaluations are [here](docs/teaching_evals.pdf).  <!--I also have <a href=docs/teaching_goals.html>ongoing goals for improving student outcomes</a>.-->

I am currently a Visiting Assistant Professor of linguistics at Western Washington University where I teach various linguistics courses at all university levels.
