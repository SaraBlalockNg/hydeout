## Work with Me

Western students interested in doing research with me should send an e-mail to sara.ng (at) wwu.edu, or discuss in person. The kind of projects I am happy to advise on include but are not limited to:

- phonetic analysis
- speech classification
- error analysis of speech technology
- speech recognition
- phonological analysis

You do not need to have a project in mind to get started doing research! Come talk to me and we can discuss ideas or existing projects that you may want to work on.
