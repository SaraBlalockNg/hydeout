Here are a couple of my favorite links for learning about Hoisanva Chinese.  I hope you find something to enjoy in these resources

From Mr. Stephen Li:

- Linguistic Overview of Taishanese (very thorough!) \[[link](https://www.stephen-li.com/TaishaneseVocabulary/Taishanese.html)\]
- Toisan Basic Course, from the Defense Language Institite \[[link](https://stephen-li.com/TaishaneseLesson/TaishaneseLessons.html)\]


From Mr. Gene Chin:
- Introductory Course to Hoisanva \[[link](https://sites.fitnyc.edu/users/gene_chin/hoisanva/index.htm)\]
- Dictionary by Radical \[[link](https://sites.fitnyc.edu/users/gene_chin/hed/)\]
- Dictionary in Alphabetical Order \[[link](http://sites.fitnyc.edu/users/gene_chin/hed-a.htm)\]

Although it is not language focused, I also highly recommend *The Eighth Promise : An American Son's Tribute to His Toisanese Mother*, by William Poy Lee. \[[link](https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/item/show/2397732030)\]
