<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I am a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at Western Washington University, a 4-year state university in beautiful 
 Bellingham, Washington near the Canada border. My research focuses on issues in computational models of prosody and speech perception. My primary 
 research concerns how computational methods can be used to better understand the role of prosody in spoken language.
I am interested in how humans use tune, rhythm, and pronunciation to convey pragmatic meaning such as discourse structure and conceptual pacts, 
and how this exchange of information is affected by hearing impairment and speech disorders.
My recent work also concerns how large commercial speech recognition systems such as OpenAI's Whisper leverage prosody.
I use corpus-based, theory-agnostic, engineering approaches with grounding in attested generalities of language acoustics.
